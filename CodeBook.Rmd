## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The run_analysis.R script performs the following:

Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder UCI HAR Dataset

Assign each data to variables
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns

activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns


1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
merged (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
tidy (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting merged, selecting only few columns

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
